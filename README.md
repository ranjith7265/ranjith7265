- Hello there!

Ranjith K here.
I'm a newcomer. Thiruvalluvar University awarded me a Bachelor of Computer Science degree.

==>  I've been actively learning and honing my full-stack web development skills. My ambition is to find a good job where I can apply my knowledge and skills in a practical setting. 
==> I've mastered front-end technologies like 
                              --> HTML
                              --> CSS
                              --> JavaScript
                              --> React
 as well as back-end technologies like 
                              --> Node.js
                              --> Express.js
 and databases like
                              --> MongoDB.

==>  I've also gained experience working with various software development tools and frameworks, such as Git , VS Code etc...

==> I am confident that my commitment and hard work in learning web development will allow me to contribute to any project on which I work. I am eager to put my skills to use in a real-world setting and collaborate with experienced developers to expand my knowledge and capabilities. I am willing to learn new technologies and adopt new methodologies that will help me achieve my professional objectives.

To summarise, I am excited about the opportunities ahead of me and look forward to applying my knowledge and skills in full-stack web development to make a positive impact on any project I work on.
